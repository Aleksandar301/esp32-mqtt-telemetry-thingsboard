# ESP32 MQTT Telemetry – ThingsBoard Integration

An embedded IoT telemetry system built on ESP32 that publishes real-time PIR motion and ultrasonic distance sensor data to ThingsBoard Cloud using the MQTT protocol.

This project demonstrates WiFi connectivity, MQTT communication, JSON telemetry formatting, and automatic reconnection handling for reliable cloud-based monitoring.
